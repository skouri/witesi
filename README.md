# witesi
Holds code for my Waterford Institute of Technology app which uses the Eve Swagger Interface.

The Eve Swagger Interface is defined here:
https://esi.evetech.net/ui/

* Stories are using extracted data as contracts may disappear from Eve Online.
* I ignore citadels currently.
* It takes a long time to load data. For now, I don't load every individual item in a contract.
* Because I don't load the items, searching by item name is currently impossible.
* Sorting can be performed on "Time Left" and "Issuer" field as of now.
